# **Week2 Assignment Reflection:**

- I managed to complete of of the basic requirements of the assignment. I think i struggled most with starting because i couldn't see anything on the screen so i felt like i was just writing things ðŸ˜…. Once i had the thumbnail container completed and visible on my screen however, it became a lot easier to complete the other elements. The main issue at the beginning is that i hadn't called any of the images i had created...
- At the beginnning i wasn't too focused on using functions but as my javascript file became longer i found myself going back to re-write certain sections as functions as it made it easier to organise everything and spot mistakes later
- I had a lot of fun with the media queries an adapiting the image gallery to mobile view.
- I even added a a toogle button to enable the user to collapse the thumbnail scroller so that they could view the image better without obstruction.
  -Tiny issue- if you have toggled the thumbnail off then increase the screen size, the thumbnail bar is still missing. Couldn't figure out how to fix this. I think i would have to use javascript
- I didn't really understand or get time to read up on and apply the 'srcset' goal for the stretch goals section
- I used a lot of my worskshops from this week as a reference to help me understand or remind me of some aspects which were required so it was really useful to have those with commented explantions
- One thing that i would like to know how to do is toggle the thumbnail images so that they move with the current image on the screen or are highlighted
